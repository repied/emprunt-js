## Develop in Devcontainer
1. Open this folder in VS Code and click **Reopen in Container** when prompted, or use the command palette: `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.
2. Once the container is built and your workspace is open, you can start a local development server.
3. The devcontainer is configured with the **Live Server** extension. You can right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server" to view the application in your browser.

The application will be available at a local URL, typically `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.
